## Log

| ID | Title | Category | Root Cause (1 line) | Detail File | Date | Status |
|----|-------|----------|----------------------|-------------|------|--------|
| F001 | Sidebar active state stayed on Tickets | WEB | Tickets used a hardcoded `active` class instead of the current route. | inline | 2026-07-25 | FIXED |
| F002 | Ticket detail action-button spacing | WEB | Detail actions lacked a shared size rule and form-action spacing. | inline | 2026-07-25 | FIXED |

## Usage Rule

- Skim the table only. Open a detail file ONLY if its title matches the current problem.
- If no match exists, proceed with normal debugging, then add a new row here before stopping.
- Keep "Root Cause" to one line — that line is what future AI sessions scan for a match.
